## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
2. Once your project is created, go to the project settings to find your API keys
3. Create the required database tables using the SQL script provided in `src/lib/db-setup.sql`
4. Optional: Add sample data using `src/lib/seed-data.sql` (don't forget to replace 'your-user-id-here' with your actual user ID)

#### Database Schema Setup

Execute the SQL script provided in `src/lib/db-setup.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor to create all necessary tables:

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `src/lib/db-setup.sql`
4. Run the query to create all tables and set up permissions

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mental-wellbeing-dashboard.git
   cd mental-wellbeing-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Adding Test Data

After setting up the database tables, you can insert test data using the SQL script in `src/lib/seed-data.sql`:

1. Go to the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Replace 'your-user-id-here' in the script with your actual user ID from Supabase auth
3. Run the script to insert sample data across all tables
